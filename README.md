# C-String
C Program to input a string and adjust memory allocation according to the length of the string.

With the help of this program, we have replicated the basic functioning, implementation and execution of the string data type in C++ and other languages, which don't require the
programmer to declare the size of the string beforehand in the form of arrays like in C.
